//Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, 
//model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.

// This sets up an object for a car with specific details
let car={
make:"toyota",
model:"corolla",
year:"2020"
};
// Accessing and showing the car's model
console.log(car.model);
// We use dot notation (car.model) to get the model of the car from our object.
