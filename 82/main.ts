//Find the Length of a String: Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of 
//characters in the string.

// This function counts how many characters are in a string
function stringLength(string:string):number{
    return string.length;
}
// Example: Measuring the length of a name
console.log(stringLength("Alice"));
// We're simply asking how long the string "Alice" is, and it tells us there are 5 characters.
