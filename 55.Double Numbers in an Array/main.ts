//Make a list of numbers. Then, use a trick to make a new list where each number is twice its original value.

//// Starts with a list of numbers
let numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6];

// Doubles each number
let doubledNumbers=numbers.map((number)=>number*2);

// Shows the new list of doubled numbers
console.log(doubledNumbers);
